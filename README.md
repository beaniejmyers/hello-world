# hello-world
My first project
I'm an accountant by training and a consultant by current trade. I've been around SQL for a long time and thought it was time to get some real training.

Just moved to the UK for a new consulting role and I've surprised myself, implemnting a data warehouse solution, analysis services, integration services, reporting services and associated web front end. Here's me thinking this was difficult. All you have to do is follow the boiuncing ball really.
